This library should be used in combination with other shim libraries, particularly:

- [JSON in JavaScript](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js)
- [ES5-Shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim)
- [ES6-Shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es6-shim)

The authors of the [ES-Shim](https://github.com/es-shims) have decided to shim in a very strict manner.
Consequently, they decided to not support some of the browsers and versions that the BetaJS framework is dedicated to support.

Therefore, this repository includes less strict shims for those browsers and versions.
We recommend to include the shims mentioned above as well as the shims provided here for full support of all browsers and versions.
